      "#### Week 1-2 (Early Luteal Phase)\n",

      "\n",
      "**Monday:**\n",
      "- **Slow Strength Training:** Focus on compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. Perform each exercise slowly and with control to maximize muscle engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tuesday:**\n",
      "- **Resistance Training:** Incorporate exercises like lunges, push-ups, and pull-ups. Maintain a slow and controlled pace.\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Rest Day:** Focus on recovery with light stretching and foam rolling.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Week 3-4 (Late Luteal Phase)\n",
      "As you approach the end of the luteal phase, you might experience a decrease in energy levels. Adjust your workouts accordingly to avoid overexertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Monday:**\n",
      "- **Resistance Training:** Continue with slow strength training, but consider reducing the intensity slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tuesday:**\n",
      "- **Power Yoga:** Maintain a moderate pace to balance strength and flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wednesday:**\n",
